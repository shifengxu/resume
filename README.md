As a full-stack engineer, I contributed to storage optimization, business logic implementation, and UI rendering. 
Given the high web traffic, we leveraged distributed systems to ensure performance and scalability.
Our newly developed features were integrated with various global partners. 
During this period, I was promoted to **Software Development Engineer II (SDE II)**.

During this time, I developed deep expertise in the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language 
and the [Chef](https://docs.chef.io/) configuration management framework. 
I also gained valuable experience in team collaboration and leadership.
Our product has been deployed across many client systems, including Windows, Linux, and AIX platforms.
