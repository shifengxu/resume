With this generator and the platform, we found much more bugs than other teams.

I work as a full-stack engineer: storage optimizing, business logic and UI rendering. 
The web traffic is very high, and we use distributed system to handle it.
Our features have been integrated to many global partners. In 2013, I was promoted to SDE II. 

### 2014.09-2020.01	IBM (Singapore) – Software Lifecycle Automation (SLA)
SLA handles enterprise security management based on a variety of security requirements and rules.

Our production has been deployed to thousands of clients (Windows, Linux, AIX).

### 2020.06-2021.08	Ascentis CRM (Singapore) – Team management and System Optimization
